The purpose of this test is to see how you design and write your code given a problem. 
Try to use right level of OOP.

Problem description:
Assume that you are attending a TV show where you can win money by picking the right box. 
The game show host shows you three boxes explaining that the money is in one of the boxes. 
He asks you to pick one of them without opening it. 
After you have picked one of the boxes he opens one of the other two boxes which is empty. 
Now he turns to you and asks, do you want to change your mind, picking the remaining box?

Your task:
Write a program (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android or Javascript for Web) randomly simulating 
this event over and over again in the quest of answering following question. 
Do I stand a better chance to win if I change my mind? Send your code in a zipped but renamed file removing the ‘.zip’ suffix. 
Else the spam filters may catch the e-mail. Include instructions on how to run the program.
Do not hesitate to ask questions if something is unclear.
